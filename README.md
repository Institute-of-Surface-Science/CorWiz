# CorWiz: Corrosion Knowledge Wizard

## Project Goal
The primary objective of CorWiz is to develop a comprehensive database encompassing a wide range of corrosion knowledge. This database will integrate both structured and unstructured data sources, including scholarly research articles.

## Challenges
Engineers currently face significant challenges in selecting accurate models and accessing pertinent data for corrosion simulations. These difficulties hinder the efficiency and effectiveness of engineering projects concerning corrosion management.

## Solution
CorWiz addresses these challenges by providing a user-friendly web tool that enables engineers to:
- Access extensive corrosion data and models.
- Retrieve relevant literature efficiently.
- Input specific parameters such as substrate material and environmental conditions to obtain:
  - Corrosion grades.
  - Simulation results.
  - Other essential structured data.

## Development
The development of CorWiz involves several key activities:
- **Data Scraping:** Extracting data from various sources.
- **Data Processing:** Transforming raw data into a usable format.
- **Quality Assessment:** Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data.

These processes are supported by tools specifically developed for the Kadi4Mat research data management platform.

## Objectives
By implementing CorWiz, we aim to:
- Streamline the design process for corrosion management.
- Raise awareness about potential corrosion issues.
- Promote more cost-effective and environmentally friendly design practices.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions from the community to enhance the capabilities of CorWiz.
Please feel free to submit issues, pull requests, or suggestions to improve the platform.
