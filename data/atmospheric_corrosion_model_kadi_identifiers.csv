"DIN EN ISO 9223:2012-05 , DIN EN ISO 9224:2012-05",2,din-en-iso-92232012-05,DIN,"ISO 9223:2012 - This International Standard establishes a classification system for the corrosivity of atmospheric environments. It:
- Defines corrosivity categories of atmospheric environments based on the corrosion rate of standard samples after the first year in an environment,   
- Provides dose-response functions for the normative estimation of the corrosivity category based on calculated mass losses due to corrosion of metallic standard samples after the first year in an environment, and   
- Enables an informative estimation of the corrosivity category based on the knowledge of the local environmental situation. 
      
This International Standard identifies the decisive factors in the atmospheric corrosion of metals and alloys. These are the temperature-humidity complex, contamination by sulfur dioxide, and the salinity of the air.

Temperature is also considered an important factor for corrosion in areas outside the temperate macroclimatic zone. The temperature-humidity complex can be evaluated in terms of wetness duration. Corrosion phenomena of other contaminants (ozone, nitrogen oxides, dust) can influence the corrosivity and the determined corrosion loss after one year; however, these factors are not considered decisive in assessing corrosivity according to this International Standard.

This International Standard does not characterize the corrosivity of specific operational atmospheres, such as atmospheres in the chemical or metallurgical industries.

The classified corrosivity categories and introduced contamination levels can be directly used for the technical and economic analysis of corrosion damage and for the rational selection of corrosion protection measures. 

ISO 9224:2012 - This International Standard specifies reference values for the corrosion attack on metals and alloys that are exposed to natural outdoor atmospheres for more than one year. This International Standard is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 9223. 

Reference values for the corrosion of standardized construction materials can be used for engineering calculations. The corrosion reference values define the technical content of each of the individual corrosivity categories for these metallic standard samples. ",
