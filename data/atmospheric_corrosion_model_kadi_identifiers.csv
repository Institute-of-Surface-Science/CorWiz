"DIN EN ISO 9223:2012-05 , DIN EN ISO 9224:2012-05",2,din-en-iso-92232012-05,DIN,"ISO 9223:2012 - This International Standard establishes a classification system for the corrosivity of atmospheric environments. It:
- Defines corrosivity categories of atmospheric environments based on the corrosion rate of standard samples after the first year in an environment,   
- Provides dose-response functions for the normative estimation of the corrosivity category based on calculated mass losses due to corrosion of metallic standard samples after the first year in an environment, and   
- Enables an informative estimation of the corrosivity category based on the knowledge of the local environmental situation. 
      
This International Standard identifies the decisive factors in the atmospheric corrosion of metals and alloys. These are the temperature-humidity complex, contamination by sulfur dioxide, and the salinity of the air.

Temperature is also considered an important factor for corrosion in areas outside the temperate macroclimatic zone. The temperature-humidity complex can be evaluated in terms of wetness duration. Corrosion phenomena of other contaminants (ozone, nitrogen oxides, dust) can influence the corrosivity and the determined corrosion loss after one year; however, these factors are not considered decisive in assessing corrosivity according to this International Standard.

This International Standard does not characterize the corrosivity of specific operational atmospheres, such as atmospheres in the chemical or metallurgical industries.

The classified corrosivity categories and introduced contamination levels can be directly used for the technical and economic analysis of corrosion damage and for the rational selection of corrosion protection measures. 

ISO 9224:2012 - This International Standard specifies reference values for the corrosion attack on metals and alloys that are exposed to natural outdoor atmospheres for more than one year. This International Standard is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 9223. 

Reference values for the corrosion of standardized construction materials can be used for engineering calculations. The corrosion reference values define the technical content of each of the individual corrosivity categories for these metallic standard samples. ",
The atmospheric corrosion kinetics of low carbon steel in a tropical marine environment,3,the_atmospheric_corrosion_kinetics_of_low_carbon_s,"Yuantai Ma, Ying Li, Fuhui Wang","This model provides the mass loss due to atmospheric corrosion for low carbon steels at different distances from the sea. The authors showed that the presence of chloride ions (Cl-) adjacent to the sea water (marine environment) and the transition point (where the corrosion rate changes with respect to time) moves forward compared to the industrial atmosphere. The corrosion speed and the exponent used to evaluate the mass loss were evaluated by corrosion experiments performed on low carbon steel (Q235), where samples were exposed to marine environment at two different exposure sites, Wanning city (marine site: 110050 eastern longitude and 18580 northern latitude; SITE 1) and Shenyang city (industrial site: 123240 eastern longitude and 41320 northern latitude; SITE 2).

A general corrosion function in terms of atmospheric pollutant concentrations and rain pH,4,a_general_corrosion_function_in_terms_of_atmospher,Michel Benarie and Frederick L. Lipfert,"Abstract-The process of atmospheric corrosion of metals can be represented by the well-known exponential expression  $$ M=a t^b $$ where $M$ is the metal loss during the exposure time ( $M: \mathrm{gm}^{-2} ; t$ : years) and $a$ and $b$ are described below. The critical review of the available corrosion test programs yielded a data basis for the statistical analysis of the parameters $a$ and $b$. If the multiplicative factor $a$ is expressed in terms of $t_w$, the time-of-wetness, which is a fraction of the total exposure time $t$, e.g. $t_w=f \cdot t$, then $a=f^b A$, and $A$ may be approximated as a linear function of the $\mathrm{SO}_2$ and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$deposition per unit surface. For example, for zinc, the following relationship holds: $$ A=4.8+0.53\left[\mathrm{SO}_2+\mathrm{Cl}^{-} \text {surface deposition, } \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{m}^{-2} \mathrm{~d}^{-1}\right] $$  Units of $A$ : weight loss per 1 wetness year, $\mathrm{g} \mathrm{m}^{-2}$. The above relationship is highly significant and represents, in conjunction with the exponential expression, a general formula for all atmospheric zinc corrosion tests, i.e. it is an effective reconciliation of corrosion results. Its predictive error is less than $\pm 50 \%$ for one-half of the cases and less than $\pm 20 \%$ in the other half. Similar expressions have been obtained for carbon steel and for copper. In the instance of carbon steel, the predictive accuracy is less than for zinc because 'carbon steel' was not exactly the same alloy on all test programs. For copper the relationship holds quite well, but the data base is yet small.  The exponent $b$, which characterizes the diffusivity of the corrosion product layer, can be expressed as a function of the average rain pH . For zinc, this relationship is: $$ b=1.55-0.142 \text { (average rain } \mathrm{pH} \text { ). } $$  The correlation is very highly significant. The physical concept explaining the parameters $a$ and $b$ is strongly supported by observations about the skyward and groundward exposed corrosion samples. Tests at sheltered sites (inside louvered cabin) also fit into the general pattern.",
