  "description": "The experimental work in the paper involves studying the corrosion behavior of low-carbon steel when immersed in various concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions over a period of time. Here's a summary of the experimental procedures:\n\n### Materials Used: \n**Low-Carbon Steel Specimens**: These were cut from a steel plate into cross-sectional specimens with dimensions of 80 mm in length, 24 mm in width, and 3 mm in thickness. Each specimen also had a 10 mm diameter hole. \n\n**NaCl Solutions**: Five different concentrations of NaCl solutions were prepared: 0%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5% by weight. \n\n### Experimental Setup: \n\n1. **Specimen Preparation**: The specimens were polished, cleaned, and dried. They were weighed with precision to three decimal places before being immersed in the NaCl solutions. \n2. **Immersion Process**: The specimens were divided into five groups, with each group immersed in one of the five different NaCl concentrations. The experiment lasted for 75 days, with continuous monitoring. \n3. **Environmental Conditions**: Compressed air was continuously supplied to the solutions to ensure sufficient oxygen for the corrosion process. The experiments were conducted at room temperature with a solution pH of 7.2. \n\n### Measurement and Analysis: \n\n**Weight Change**: The weight of each specimen was measured seven times throughout the experiment to track changes due to corrosion. \n\n**Corrosion Rate**: The corrosion rate was calculated based on the weight change over time using established empirical models.",
