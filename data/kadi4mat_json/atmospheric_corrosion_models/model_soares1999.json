  "description": "The model described in Equation 6 of the paper by Soares and Garbatov (see Soares1999) is a non-linear model for corrosion degradation over time. The model is designed to capture the three distinct phases of corrosion typically observed in marine structures:  \n1. **Initial Phase (Protection Phase)**: During this phase, the metal surface is protected by a coating, and there is no corrosion. This phase lasts until the coating loses its effectiveness.     \n2. **Active Corrosion Phase**: Once the coating is compromised, corrosion begins, and the thickness of the plate decreases. This phase is characterized by an exponential increase in corrosion wastage.     \n3. **Stabilization Phase**: Eventually, the corrosion process slows down as the corroded material forms a layer that protects the underlying metal from further exposure to the corrosive environment, effectively halting the corrosion process.  \n\nThe mathematical representation of the model is given by the differential equation:  \n$$ d(t) = d_{\\infty} (1 - e^{-(t - q_c)/q_t}) $$  \n\nHere:\n\n$d(t)$ is the thickness of the corrosion wastage at time $t$. \n\n$d_{\\infty}$ is the long-term thickness of the corrosion wastage. \n\n$q_c$ is the coating life, the time interval during which the coating is effective. \n\n$q_t$ is the transition time, which determines the rate at which the corrosion process progresses after the coating fails.",
