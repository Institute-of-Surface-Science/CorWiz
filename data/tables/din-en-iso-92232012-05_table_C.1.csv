Corrosivity Category (C),Corrosivity,Typical Environments — Examples Indoor,Typical Environments — Examples Outdoor
C1,insignificant,"Heated rooms with low relative humidity and insignificant air pollution, e.g., offices, schools, museums.","Dry or cold climate zone, atmospheric environment with very low pollution and short wetting duration, e.g., certain desert areas, central Arctic/Antarctic."
C2,low,"Unheated rooms with fluctuating temperature and relative humidity. Rare condensation and low air pollution, e.g., storage rooms, sports halls.","Temperate climate zone, atmospheric environment with low air pollution (SO2 < 5 μg/m3), e.g., rural areas, small towns. Dry or cold climate zone, atmospheric environment with short wetting duration, e.g., deserts, subarctic regions."
C3,moderate,"Rooms with occasional condensation and moderate air pollution from production processes, e.g., food processing plants, laundries, breweries, dairies.","Temperate climate zone, atmospheric environment with moderate air pollution (SO2: 5 μg/m3 to 30 μg/m3), or with low chloride influence, e.g., urban areas, coastal areas with low chloride deposits. Subtropical and tropical climate zone, atmosphere with low pollution."
C4,high,"Rooms with frequent condensation and high air pollution from production processes, e.g., industrial plants, swimming pools.","Temperate climate zone, atmospheric environment with high air pollution (SO2: 30 μg/m3 to 90 μg/m3) or significant chloride influence, e.g., urban areas with air pollution, industrial areas, coastal areas not within saltwater spray range, heavy de-icing salt exposure. Subtropical and tropical climate zone, atmosphere with moderate pollution."
C5,very high,"Rooms with very high frequency of condensation and/or high air pollution from production processes, e.g., mines, industrial cavities, non-ventilated halls in subtropical and tropical climate zones.","Temperate and subtropical climate zone, atmospheric environment with very high air pollution (SO2: 90 μg/m3 to 250 μg/m3), and/or significant chloride influence, e.g., industrial areas, coastal areas, sheltered locations on the coastline."
CX,extreme,"Rooms with nearly constant condensation or extended periods of exposure to extremely high humidity and/or high air pollution from production processes, e.g., non-ventilated halls in humid tropical climates with invasive pollution from outside air, including airborne chlorides and corrosion-promoting dust.","Subtropical and tropical climate zone (very long wetting duration), atmospheric environment with very high air pollution from SO2 (more than 250 μg/m3) including accompanying and production-related pollution and/or heavily influenced by chlorides, e.g., areas with intense industrial use with extremely high pollution, coastal and offshore areas, occasional salt spray contact."
