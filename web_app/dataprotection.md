### Use of Cookies
We use so-called cookies on different pages to make visiting our website more user-friendly and to enable the use of certain functions. These are small text files that are stored on your device. Some of the cookies that we use are deleted at the end of the browser session, i.e. after you close your browser (so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your device and allow us or our partner companies to identify your browser the next time you pay a visit (persistent cookies). You can configure your browser to be informed whenever a cookie is placed, to accept or reject them in certain cases, or to completely disable their use. If you do not accept cookies, some functions on our website may be restricted.
Technically necessary cookies allow you to navigate our website and use its functions. Without these cookies, the functionality of certain features, such as actions made by you during a visit (e.g. text entry), cannot be guaranteed when navigating between various parts of the website.

Functional cookies make it possible for a website to store certain provided information (e.g. user name, language selection, or location information) and enhance the opportunity to offer users personal functions. These cookies gather anonymised information and cannot trace your activities on other websites.

Performance cookies gather information about the use of a website, for example which pages a user visits most often or whether the website transmits an error notification. These cookies do not store any information that allows users to be identified. The collected data are compiled and anonymised. These cookies are exclusively used to improve website performance and thereby its user-friendliness.

If you do not wish for Hereon to gather and analyse information about your visit, you have the option to object thereto at any time, with future effect (opt-out).
An opt-out cookie is stored in the browser for the technical realisation of said objection. This cookie solely serves to represent your objection. Please note that opt-out cookies, for technical reasons, can only be used for the browser that was used when it was stored. If you delete cookies or use a different browser or device, you must deregister again.

### Web Analysis
For the statistical analysis of page views, we use tools like AWStats, Matomo, and Webalizer. The IP addresses are anonymized immediately after processing and before storage.

### Statistical Evaluation using Matomo
This website uses Matomo, open-source software for the statistical analysis of visitor accesses. Matomo uses so-called “Cookies”, which are text files that are stored on your computer and allow for an analysis of your use of the website. The “session cookies” used are text files that are stored on your computer. As soon as the web browser is closed, they are deleted. The information collected by the cookie on your use of our Internet offer is transferred to a server hosted in a German computer centre. The collected data are not transferred to third parties and serve to identify and improve relevant content of our Internet offer.

The IP address is anonymised immediately after processing and before storage. Matomo is configured pursuant to the recommendations of the Unabhängiges Landeszentrum für Datenschutz (ULD) [Independent State Centre for Data Protection], in line with the applicable data protection provisions. By using this website, you consent to the processing of the data collected on you, in the manner described, and only for the stated purpose.

### Withdrawal of Consent to Data Collection by Matomo
When deactivating the web analysis, a “permanent cookie” is stored on your computer if your browser is configured accordingly. This cookie informs Matomo not to collect data on your browser.

Please note that the Matomo deactivation cookie is deleted if you clear the cookies stored in your browser. You also need to deactivate the web analysis again if you use a different computer or web browser.
